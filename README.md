Simple AI collision detection and avoidance system using Javascript
Run the system by opening Index.html and click the "Start" button.
This is a simple AI collision detection and avoidance system that detects and avoids crashing with walls. The object has 4 bodies, 3 active and detectors aka sensors. The bodies detect when they collide with a wall and try to estimate the walls' next path and avoid collision through a very basic and simple system of  machine learning algorithm coded in Javascript.
